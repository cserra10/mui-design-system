# mui-design-system
Design System that uses material-ui, storybook and rollup


By powering your enterprise frontend applications with mui-design-system you will be able to:

- Develop many ui themes for your web apps. Start creating light, dark, christmas, etc themes using our `themes` app which includes a web dashboard to create themes and visualize them in real time.

- Develop your own `ui-library`. Start creating your own react component library using our `ui-library` boilerplate. Then you can publish it to your private npm repository.

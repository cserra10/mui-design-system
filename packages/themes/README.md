###What a theme is?
A theme is a JS object that specifies the color of the components, darkness of the surfaces, level of shadow, appropriate opacity of ink elements, etc.

Themes let you apply a consistent tone to your app. It allows you to customize all design aspects of your project in order to meet the specific needs of your business or brand.

const myTheme = {
    palette: {
        primary: {
            light: "#7986cb",
            main: "#3f51b5",
            dark: "#303f9f",
            contrastText: "#fff"
        },
